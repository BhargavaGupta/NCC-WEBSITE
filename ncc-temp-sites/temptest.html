    <h1>National Cadet Corps (NCC)</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <p>The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is the youth wing of the Indian Armed Forces with its headquarters in New Delhi, India. It is open to school and college students on a voluntary basis as a Tri-Services Organisation, comprising the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. Cadets are given basic military training in small arms and drill. Officers and cadets have no liability for active military service once they complete their course.</p>

    <h2>NCC Flag</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <img src="ncc-flag.jpg" alt="NCC Flag">
        <p>The NCC flag for various units of the NCC was first introduced in 1951. The first flag was of the same pattern, colour, and size as used by various regiments of the Army. The only difference was that it had the NCC badge and unit designation placed in the centre. Later, it was felt that the flag should be designed to keep the inter-service character of the Corps. In 1954 the existing Tri-colour flag was introduced. The three colours in the flag depict the three services of the Corps: red for the Army, deep blue for the Navy, and light blue for the Air Force. The letters NCC and the NCC crest in gold in the middle of the flag encircled by a wreath of lotus give the flag a colourful look and a distinct identity.</p>

    <h2>Establishment of NCC Song</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>An official song of the NCC titled <i>"Kadam Mila Ke Chal"</i> was adopted in 1963. This was, however, changed to the current NCC Song titled <i>"Ham Sabh Bhartiya Hain"</i> in October 1982. "Ham Sabh Bhartiya Hain" - NCC song is written by Sudarshan Fakir.</p>
